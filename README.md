CLIP Analysis Pipeline - CLAP, is used to analyse CLIP-seq (specifically PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP) data. The family of protocols where cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing are referred to as CLIP. They are used identify binding sites of RNA-binding proteins and exist in the different flavours mentioned above. The data produced by these protocols have different characteristics which are account for in this pipeline such that it can be used to process the above three versions and combination of them like iCLIP using 4SU nucleosides (PAR-iCLIP).

## 1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
A relatively powerful PC, minimun 4 GB memory and with Linux installed. The pipeline is tested on Ubuntu 16.04, in principle it should run on a standard Linux setup with BASH Shell and some version of awk installed. We will not guarantee that the
pipeline works on Apple computers, it could as they are based on FreeBSD, but we provide no support to the end of making it run on a Mac.

## 2. INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
1. Install Python (link https://www.python.org/)

2. Install bwa-pssm (https://github.com/pkerpedjiev/bwa-pssm)

3. Install bedTools (http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

4. Install pyicos (https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/pyicoteo)

5. Download mapping indexes and other files from (https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/F1j2xb0jdB), copy to the folder CLAP, unpack and and merge with folder CLAP/resources (it should happen automatically)

6. Set paths in scripts/CLAP.sh 
Mapper: bwa-pssm (set path of executable) <BR>

## 3. FURTHER CONFIGURATION
Currently the pipeline is set up with an hg19 assemly and a processed ENSEMBL annotation. If one wished to analyze data from a different species or use a different annotation it has to be integrated following a number of steps. The scripts we provide assumes an ENSEMBL annotation GTF file, it will most likely not work with other types of anotation.

Updating annotation:
1. Download ENSEMBL annotation (here the newest Mouse assembly) 
        
        wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-87/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.87.chr.gtf.gz

2. Unzip the gtf file

        gunzip Mus_musculus.GRCm38.87.chr.gtf.gz
        
2. Process annotation to bed-file

        scripts/create_mRNA_genome_annotation3.pl <GTF-file> <OUTPUT-FILE>

Getting sequence Files:
1. Dwonload sequence file

        wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-87/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz

2. Unzip the fasta

        gunzip Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz

3. Process fasta file

## 4. TEST-EXAMPLE
To test that everything works, run:

        CLAP/testCLAP.sh

It maps, does peak calling and produces a UCSC custom track from reads that map to chr4 in the PAR-CLIP dataset SRR248532.

Example analyses:

    PAR-CLIP (substitution model and no barcodes)
    scripts/CLAP.sh fastq-file TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG "" 0 1 2 1 1 2 0 Analysis_name 1 8 1

    HITS-CLIP (no substitution model and no barcodes)
    scripts/CLAP.sh fastq-file TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG "" 0 1 2 1 1 2 1 Analysis_name 1 8 1

    iCLIP (with multiplexing and duplication barcodes)
    scripts/CLAP.sh fastq-file TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG GGTT 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 Analysis_name 1 8 1

The default substitution model has a T to C conversion rate at 12,5 %. A substitution model with different conversion probability can be created with the script scripts/mk_errorModel.py or the more general script where conversions from and to any nucleotide can be specified (See the repository of BWA-PSSM). <BR>
